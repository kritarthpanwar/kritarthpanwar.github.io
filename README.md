 Hello! I am Kritarth Panwar; a first year student at Simon Fraser University, Burnaby, BC. I am currently pursuing Computer science and plan to specialise in Artificial intelligence and Machine learning. This career was sparked by my interest in innovations in technology throughout my childhood. Therefore, I am pursuing Computer science to learn more about technological innovations and what goes on behind the screens of our devices. This repository consist of the various projects and programs I created through my CS journey.
